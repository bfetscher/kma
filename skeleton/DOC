========== Buddy System ==========
The buddy system has quite good average resource utilization, because it tries to coalesce adjacent regions ("buddies") whenever possible to create larger free regions that can then be split and allocated again on request. On the given traces, it only requests about half as many pages as power of two free lists. One drawback of both systems in this regard is that they can only allocate memory in powers of two, which can result in bad resource utilization if the requests are slightly larger than a power-of-two (e.g. 2^n+1). 
The performance of the buddy system is not too good because it needs to check the bitmap of free buffers after every kma_free request and decide whether to coalesce. This can result in very bad worst-case performance if free and alloc requests alternate, because the allocator will try to coalesce regions every time, only to immediately split them again to serve the alloc request. On the traces provided, kma_bud is faster than kma_p2fl when there are a lot of requests (traces 4&5,) because it needs less pages and the size of the free lists it needs to maintain are smaller. However, it takes longer when there are not a lot of requests (traces 1-3,) presumably due to the cost of checking for coalescable regions.
